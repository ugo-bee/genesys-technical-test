#given a list of integers, create a function that returns the nth-rarest item.the funtion should 
#be called nth_most_rate signature and its nth_most_rate signature(list,n) where list is the array of 
#integers and n is the nth rarest item.For Example in([5,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,3,3,3,2,2,1,5]),if 2 is supplied as n
#the answer is 2 as 2 is the second rarest item
